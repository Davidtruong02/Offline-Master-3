## Installation
Steps to Install

Download or clone the repository to your local desktop or laptop.
Navigate to the correct directory where you saved the cloned repo.
Run 'npm i or install' to install the required dependencies.


## Description
For this module's challenge take the knowledge of what we learn during the PWA module and given the starter code, we are to edit the code to make the code functional both online and offline where it saves
edited text!

## Usage
To use the application, follow the step provided:
Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies in your terminal in the general folder, not any specific folder.
then npm run dev in (server folder => server.js) in terminal to get app started


## User Story

```md
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a text editor web application
WHEN I open my application in my editor
THEN I should see a client server folder structure
WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory
THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client
WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal
THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack
WHEN I run my webpack plugins
THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application
THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors
WHEN I open the text editor
THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
WHEN I click on the Install button
THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop
WHEN I load my web application
THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox
WHEN I register a service worker
THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
WHEN I deploy to Render
THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
```

## Mock-Up
The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
